// IN GAME RULES // 

Merchant Manners:
-The merchants of Faerun have things hard as it is, you may not steal from them. IF a merchant dies in combat (Raid on Moonrise For Example), you are more than welcome to loot their body. They dont need that axe where they are now. 
-No Merchant Restock Exploit with Leveling

I Rolled A 1, I Rolled A 1, F***:
-Inspiration is enabled, BUT, in a social roll, if you roll a 1, inspiration is barred. Calling that goblin's mom "phat" probably didn't go well for you.

Jack Of Like, TWO Trades:
-You may only multiclass into one other class. All you Fighter/Monks rejoice.

Character Development:
-Respeccing is only allowed when you acquire a character, OR, if there is a plot significant reason that you can argue. This is up for interpretation, but the goal is to not respec for every fight to just have the best group. 
-Some examples of plot significance could be Oathbreaker Lae'zel after [REDACTED] OR Paladin Shadowheart post=Nightsong.

Barrel Sized Pockets:
=Moving/Using barrels in an area is fine, but no taking them out of the area they are found in. You may use the Zhent barrels in the Goblin camp, but may not take them out. 

// MODS RULING // 
DISCLAIMER: REFER TO README
=You may use any mods that do not affect gameplay. All hairstyles, body types, UI improvements, QOL is all fair game. If it's low impact like Gold weight negation, I DO NOT care lol, it is NOT game changing enough to invalidate anything.
