Noiselocke Ruleset 

// SETTING THE GAME UP // 
The point is for a hard BG3 experience, not a frustrating one. There are MANY interactions in this game that can randomly end a run for you on permadeath, and I personally dont find that to be a satisfying loss! So we scale the difficulty up, but allow save loading within parameters.

Custom Mode Options:
Ruleset: Honour Ruleset
Single Save: OFF
Enemy Aggresion/Char Power/Loadouts/Combat Mechs: Tactician
Prof Bonus: Normal
Enemy Crits: On
No Death Saving Throws: Off
Disable Free First Strikes: On
Entire rest default

// BANNED CLASSES // 
These are classes I feel are too overtuned and defeat the point of challenge. I want them to be barred from play for this run specifically to force us all to try out other fun multiclasses.

11 Sorcerer 1 Warlock - Sorlock

8 Monk 4 Rogue - Fist Of The Night

10 Bard 2 Paladin - The Chord of Gods

SPECIFICALLY Throwzerker 12 Barb

// IN GAME RULES // 

It's Ok, That's The Game:
You may load a save ONLY if you wipe. There is no reloading to get better dialogue, pass a lockpick skill check, or retry an in-field check. Just play your lockpicks and take the disarm failure damage.

Merchant Manners:
-The merchants of Faerun have things hard as it is, you may not steal from them. IF a merchant dies in combat (Raid on Moonrise For Example), you are more than welcome to loot their body. They dont need that axe where they are now. 
-No Merchant Restock Exploit with Leveling

I Rolled A 1, I Rolled A 1, F***:
-Inspiration is enabled, BUT, in a social roll, if you roll a 1, inspiration is barred. Calling that goblin's mom "phat" probably didn't go well for you.

Jack Of Like, TWO Trades:
-You may only multiclass into one other class. All you Fighter/Monks rejoice.

Character Development:
-Respeccing is only allowed when you acquire a character, OR, if there is a plot significant reason that you can argue. This is up for interpretation, but the goal is to not respec for every fight to just have the best group. 
-Some examples of plot significance could be Oathbreaker Lae'zel after [REDACTED] OR Paladin Shadowheart post=Nightsong.

Barrel Sized Pockets:
=Moving/Using barrels in an area is fine, but no taking them out of the area they are found in. You may use the Zhent barrels in the Goblin camp, but may not take them out. 

// MODS RULING // 
DISCLAIMER: REFER TO README
=You may use any mods that do not affect gameplay. All hairstyles, body types, UI improvements, QOL is all fair game. If it's low impact like Gold weight negation, I DO NOT care lol, it is NOT game changing enough to invalidate anything.
