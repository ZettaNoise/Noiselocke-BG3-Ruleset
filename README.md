Hey all! My name is ZettaNoise and I'm the creator of this Baldur's Gate 3 ruleset. I was looking for a non-permadeath challenge run for Baldur's Gate 3, and didn't see anyone with a full ruleset, just a lot of ideas for fun rules. So, I decided I would compile the best and see how they play out live, whether you are seeing this at the time of posting, or YEARS later, I will make sure to keep the VODs public for anyone who wants to see how well it plays out, and I will aim to keep the repository updated with how the different challenge rules feel. 

This ruleset is made to be played all together as a cohesive challenge experience, but I would like to make it clear, that there is NO gatekeeping on this set. If you want to play it your way, and add some rules, take some out, that is your decision. I want this to be a resource for people to come up with more fun rulesets for themselves! So play nice with each other and don't be cringe about rulesharking!

MEDIA DISCLAIMER: Feel free to share the ruleset as a link to the repository directly! Please credit me in any coverage of the ruleset, and any of the creators tagged in it. That exposure gets us more support to be able to make more of these for other titles, and it would be massively appreciated!
